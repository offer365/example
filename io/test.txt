Reading and writing files are basic tasks needed for many Go programs. First we’ll look at some examples of reading files.
You’ll often want more control over how and what parts of a file are read. For these tasks, start by Opening a file to obtain an os.File value.
Content and build toolchain for Go by Example, a site that teaches Go via annotated example programs.
The Go by Example site is built by extracting code and comments from source files in examples and rendering them via the templates into a static public directory. The programs implementing this build process are in tools, along with some vendor'd dependencies in vendor.
The built public directory can be served by any static content system. The production site uses S3 and CloudFront, for example.
